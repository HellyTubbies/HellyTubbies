Hey, whats up? I'm Helly!
I'm ur average everyday dude on github just looking at stuff people have created! Currently though, I dont do coding.. but I do want to get into it! I'm very, very interested in code digging! even though i have no clue what I'm even looking at xD

Currently my main code interest is Java, As I play a game i think is pretty well known by now called Minecraft! I do want to get into modding as well!
